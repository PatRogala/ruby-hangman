# Ruby Console Hangman
Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

[Live Demo](https://replit.com/@PatRogala/ruby-hangman)

## Start the game
```shell
ruby game.rb
```

### Functionality
A ruby impementation of [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).
Additionally, unlike the paper and pencil version the user is able to save and load games from .save files

### A word from me
This is my first project using file I/O and serialization. To create save/load game feature i used serialization on my hangman object to convert it into YAML string and save it into .save file.
If u find any bug, or have any idea how to improve game please let me know. :)
